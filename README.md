# Rust Mock Shootout!

Rust has several different mocking libraries.  None is clearly superior to all
of the others.  This project compares their feature sets, using an
apples-to-apples approach.  Each of several dozen features is implemented with
multiple mocking libraries, if possible.  The test results then show which
features work with which library.

See the full results at https://asomers.github.io/mock_shootout/ .
